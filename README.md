Curtains
========

A javascript plugin for creating pages that are revealed when the previous page lifts up like curtains rising.  


Scrolling down moves the current page up the screen. The next page is fixed behind, revealed as the bottom of the current page becomes visible and moves up the screen. When the current page is no longer visible, the next page will start to move up the screen.
